## Master's Capstone Project

**Improving GHG Data Analysis Workflow for an Outdoor Apparel Company**

- **Client**: Darn Tough Vermont
- **Language**: R
- **Blog**: [[link]](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-6-20-post/)
- **Description**: Collaborated with three classmates and the companyâ€™s Sustainability Director to create an interactive dashboard web application for GHG data tracking and scenario analysis, replacing previous Excel-only workflow. Managed all data products on private code repositories, and created metadata and documentation for reproducibility.

## Master's Course Projects

**Time Series Analysis of Chesapeake Bay Pollution**

- **Course**: Statistics
- **Type**: Self-Guided Final Project
- **Language**: Python
- **Repo**: [[link]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/chesapeake-bay-nutrient-pollution-python)
- **Description**: Investigated trends in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations using 43,000 automated sensor readings from 2010 to 2019. Cleaned and processed time series data, and built STL decomposition models. Tuned season length based on autocorrelation of time lags. Visualized model parameters, ran regressions, and interpreted results.

**Infographic on Methane Emissions**

- **Course**: Data Visualization
- **Type**: Self-Guided Final Project
- **Language**: R
- **Repo**: [[link]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/methane-infographic)
- **Description**: Analyzed data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) to create an infographic on methane emissions, including advanced visuals such as treemap, annotated scatterplot, and dodged column plot. Synthesized scholarly sources (IEA, Journal of Environmental Science & Technology, etc.) to write infographic content.

**Bird Species Egg Volume Variation Analysis**

- **Course**: Databases & Data Management
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: Python & SQL
- **Repo**: [link](https://github.com/linusghanadan/bird-species-analysis.git)
- **Description**: Created SQLite database from CSVs and schema build SQL script, queried to fetch distinct species names, created cursor, and stored the species data. Iterated over species data, querying the database to fetch egg volume data for each species, loading data into pandas DataFrame, and computing coefficients of variation for each species.

**Dynamic Simulation of Forest Growth**

- **Course**: Modeling Environmental Systems
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: R
- **Repo**: [[Repo]]([https://github.com/linusghanadan/dic-ml-models](https://github.com/linusghanadan/dynamic-simulation-forest-growth))
- **Description**: Synthesized ocean chemistry features to build and tune random forest model and stochastic gradient boosted trees model. Compared root mean square errors and analyzed feature importances in the best performing model.

**Predictive Regression Models of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon**

- **Course**: Machine Learning
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: Python
- **Repo**: [[Repo]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/dic-ml-models)
- **Description**: Synthesized ocean chemistry features to build and tune random forest model and stochastic gradient boosted trees model. Compared root mean square errors and analyzed feature importances in the best performing model.

**Econometric Analysis of Cash-Transfer Program**

- **Course**: Policy Evaluation
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: R
- **Repo**: [[Repo]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/cash-transfer-policy)
- **Description**: Compared pre-treatment characteristics in the treatment and control groups. Estimated the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of program enrollment on a householdâ€™s value of owned animals using FE, FD, and DiD estimators.

**Geospatial Analysis of Biodiversity Loss**

- **Course**: Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: Python
- **Repo**: [[link]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/phoenix_biodiversity)
- **Description**: Fetched grid-cell data on Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) scores from Microsoft data catalog. Clipped rasters of 2017 and 2020 BII scores with polygon shapefile of Phoenix subdivision. Created heatmap of 2020 BII scores in Phoenix, highlighting areas that had decreased below 0.75 threshold since 2017 study.
