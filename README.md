### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Linus Ghanadan!

I am a purpose-driven worker interested in a career that leverages data to inform projects aligned with my environmentalist values. In my spare time, I like to play soccerâš½ and go on hikesðŸ¥¾.

I graduated in June 2024 with a M.S. in **Environmental Data Science** from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. As a Masterâ€™s capstone project, I worked with the outdoor apparel company Darn Tough Vermont to streamline their workflow for carbon accounting and sustainability analysis, creating an interactive web-application dashboard for the company to visualize historical emissions and run scenarios based on adjustable input variables.

In May 2023, I received a B.S. in **Environmental Economics** from the University of Maryland, and while a student, I also gained research and internship experience at the World Resources Institute, U.S. Department of Transportation, and The Nature Conservancy. In these roles, I worked on several projects that relate to the energy transition, including projects on offshore wind development and transport electrification.

In particular, I am interested in the **clean energy sector**. My industry knowledge comes largely from personal research and classes that I took at the University of Maryland on Energy & Environmental Economics and Energy & Environmental Policy. In these classes, I learned about topics such as the structure of electricity markets (wholesale, retail, capacity, and PPA), modeling energy supply and demand based on incentives, calculating LCOE and LACE, and the exciting implications of technological innovation (e.g., BESS, grid-connected microgrids, automated distribution, in-home smart meters, etc.).
