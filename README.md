## Master's Capstone Project

**Improving GHG Data Analysis Workflow for an Outdoor Apparel Company**

- **Client**: Darn Tough Vermont
- **Language**: R
- **Blog**: [[link]](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-6-20-post/)
- **Description**: Collaborated with three classmates and the companyâ€™s Sustainability Director to create a web application for GHG data tracking and scenario analysis, replacing previous Excel-only workflow. Managed all data products on private code repositories, and created metadata and documentation for reproducibility.

## Master's Course Projects

**Time Series Analysis of Chesapeake Bay Pollution**

- **Course**: Statistics
- **Type**: Self-Guided Final Project
- **Language**: Python
- **Repo**: [[link]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/chesapeake-bay-nutrient-pollution-python)
- **Description**: Investigated trends in 43,000 automated readings of nitrogen and phosphorus concentration from 2010 to 2019 through building STL decomposition models. Tuned season length based on autocorrelation of time lags. Visualized model parameters, ran regressions, and interpreted results.

**Infographic on Methane Emissions**

- **Course**: Data Visualization
- **Type**: Self-Guided Final Project
- **Language**: R
- **Repo**: [[link]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/methane-infographic)
- **Description**: Analyzed data from the International Energy Agency to create an infographic on methane emissions, including intricately designed treemap, scatterplot, and dodged column plot.

**Geospatial Analysis of Biodiversity Loss in Phoenix**

- **Course**: Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: Python
- **Repo**: [[link]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/phoenix_biodiversity)
- **Description**: Leveraged Microsoft Planetary Computer Data Catalog to retrieve grid-cell data on Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) scores. Clipped raster of BII scores with polygon shapefile of Phoenix subdivision. Calculated percent of area where BII decreased from being above threshold in 2017 to being below threshold in 2020. Created heatmap of 2020 BII scores across Phoenixâ€™s subdivision, highlighting areas that decreased below the threshold.

**Econometric Analysis of 1998 Mexican Cash-Transfer Program**

- **Course**: Policy Evaluation
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: R
- **Repo**: [[Repo]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/cash-transfer-policy)
- **Description**: Compared pre-treatment characteristics in the treatment and control groups. Estimated the Average Treatment Effect of program enrollment on a householdâ€™s value of owned animals using FE, FD, and DiD estimators.

**Predictive Regression Models of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon**

- **Course**: Machine Learning
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: Python
- **Repo**: [[Repo]](https://github.com/linusghanadan/dic-ml-models)
- **Description**: Synthesized ocean chemistry features to build and tune random forest model and stochastic gradient boosted trees model. Compared root mean square errors and analyzed feature importances in the best performing model.

**Bird Species Egg Volume Variation Analysis**

- **Course**: Databases & Data Management
- **Type**: Guided Project
- **Language**: Python & SQL
- **Repo**: [link](https://github.com/linusghanadan/bird-species-analysis.git)
- **Description**: Created SQLite database from CSVs and schema build script, queried to fetch distinct species names, created cursor, and stored species data. Iterated over species data, querying the database to fetch egg volume data for each species, loading data into pandas DataFrame, and computing coefficients of variation for each species.
